I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Planning and Sustainability at the University of Northern British Columbia. Prior to joining UNBC, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Westman Centre for Real Estate Studies and a Sessional Instructor in the School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape at the University of Calgary.

My academic background includes a PhD from the University of Calgary, a Master of Arts (Planning) from the University of Waterloo and a Bachelor of Arts (Geography) with Distinction from the University of Regina. I am also a Full Member (MCIP) in the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP) and a Registered Professional Planner (RPP) with the Alberta Professional Planners Institute (APPI).
