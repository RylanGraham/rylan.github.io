I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Planning and Sustainability at the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). To learn more about the planning program at UNBC visit the school [website](https://www2.unbc.ca/school-planning-and-sustainability). 

Background
======

Prior to joining UNBC, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Westman Centre for Real Estate Studies](https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/westman-centre) and a Sessional Instructor in the [School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape](https://sapl.ucalgary.ca) at the University of Calgary. I received my PhD from the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca), a Master of Arts (Planning) from the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca) and a Bachelor of Arts (Geography) with Distinction from the [University of Regina](http://www.uregina.ca). I am a Full Member (MCIP) in the Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP) and a Registered Professional Planner (RPP) with the Planners Institute of British Columbia (PIBC). I have also practiced as a planner throughout Western Canada. 

Research Interests 
======
I have broad interests across the planning discipline and am passionate about building more sustainable, liveable and vibrant cities. My research interests centre around the topics of urban sprawl, growth management, intensification, downtown revitalization, and with a particular interest in mid-sized Canadian cities.
