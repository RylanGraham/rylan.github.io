Since the late 1990s, Smart Growth has found broad acceptance within Canadian planning as a framework for sustainable urban development. Smart Growth emerged as a response to decades of dispersed and decentralized growth that dominated urbanization patterns in North America post-WWII. Through a series of spatial analysis methods, this research examines whether Smart Growth has influenced growth patterns of six mid-sized Canadian census metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2010. Findings of this research suggest that municipalities and regions have adopted policies consistent with Smart Growth, however, its influence on dispersed patterns of spatial growth has been limited.
